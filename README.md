# tiny-cars-shop

Ecommerce template created with modern vanilla JavaScript (modules, es6), Sass(.scss) and HTML5. I used webpack 4 to bundle multiple .js files into two files. Products and informations associated with them are loaded dynamically from contentful cms. To store current cart content I took advantage of LocalStorage. Website includes two subpages ('Shop rules', '
Privacy Policy'), you can manage your cart, delete items or change their amount not only on home page but also on those two additional subpages.
